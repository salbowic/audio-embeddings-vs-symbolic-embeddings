# Data Processing Database

## Overview
This codebase contains scripts and utilities for converting between various musical data formats, including ABC notation, MusicXML, MIDI, and MTF (MIDI Text Format). Additionally, it includes a script for summarizing music metadata, which is represented in JSON format containing textual information, using the OpenAI GPT-4 API. The GPT-4 model processes this metadata to generate concise summaries in multiple languages to boost multilingual MIR. These tools are designed to facilitate the transformation and manipulation of musical files, as well as to provide concise multilingual summaries of music metadata for use with CLaMP 2.


## About ABC notation
### Standard ABC Notation  
ABC notation (sheet music), a text-based sheet music representation like stave notation, is theory-oriented and ideal for presenting complex musical concepts to musicians for study and analysis. Standard ABC notation encodes each voice separately, which often results in corresponding bars being spaced far apart. This separation makes it difficult for models to accurately understand the interactions between voices in sheet music that are meant to align musically.

Example Standard ABC notation representation:  
```
%%score { 1 | 2 }
L:1/8
Q:1/4=120
M:3/4
K:G
V:1 treble nm="Piano" snm="Pno."
V:2 bass
V:1
!mf!"^Allegro" d2 (GA Bc | d2) .G2 .G2 |]
V:2
[G,B,D]4 A,2 | B,6 |]
```

### Interleaved ABC Notation  
In contrast, interleaved ABC notation effectively aligns multi-track music by integrating multiple voices of the same bar into a single line, ensuring that all parts remain synchronized. This format combines voices in-line and tags each bar with its corresponding voice (e.g., `[V:1]` for treble and `[V:2]` for bass). By directly aligning related bars, interleaved ABC notation enhances the model’s understanding of how different voices interact within the same bar.

Below is the same data optimized with M3 encoding, where each bar or header corresponds to a patch:  
```
%%score { 1 | 2 }
L:1/8
Q:1/4=120
M:3/4
K:G
V:1 treble nm="Piano" snm="Pno."
V:2 bass
[V:1]!mf!"^Allegro" d2 (GA Bc|[V:2][G,B,D]4 A,2|
[V:1]d2) .G2 .G2|][V:2]B,6|]
```

## About MTF
### Raw MIDI Messages  
MIDI (performance data) precisely encodes performance information related to timing and dynamics, thus suitable for music production and live performance. Raw MIDI messages contain essential musical instructions and metadata, extracted directly from a MIDI file. These include events like note on/off, tempo changes, key signatures, and control changes, which define how the music is performed. The [mido library](https://mido.readthedocs.io/) allows for reading these messages in their native format, as seen below. Each message can include multiple parameters, making the output comprehensive but sometimes redundant.  

```
MetaMessage ('time_signature', numerator=3, denominator=4, clocks_per_click=24, notated_32nd_notes_per_beat=8, time=0)
MetaMessage('key_signature', key='G', time=0)
MetaMessage('set_tempo', tempo=500000, time=0)
control_change channel=0 control=121 value=0 time=0
program_change channel=0 program=0 time=0
control_change channel=0 control=7 value=100 time=0
control_change channel=0 control=10 value=64 time=0
control_change channel=0 control=91 value=0 time=0
control_change channel=0 control=93 value=0 time=0
MetaMessage('midi_port', port=0, time=0)
note_on channel=0 note=74 velocity=80 time=0
MetaMessage('key_signature', key='G', time=0)
MetaMessage('midi_port', port=0, time=0)
note_on channel=0 note=55 velocity=80 time=0
note_on channel=0 note=59 velocity=80 time=0
note_on channel=0 note=62 velocity=80 time=0
note_on channel=0 note=74 velocity=0 time=455
note_on channel=0 note=67 velocity=80 time=25
note_on channel=0 note=67 velocity=0 time=239
note_on channel=0 note=69 velocity=80 time=1
note_on channel=0 note=55 velocity=0 time=191
note_on channel=0 note=59 velocity=0 time=0
note_on channel=0 note=62 velocity=0 time=0
note_on channel=0 note=69 velocity=0 time=48
note_on channel=0 note=71 velocity=80 time=1
note_on channel=0 note=57 velocity=80 time=0
note_on channel=0 note=71 velocity=0 time=239
note_on channel=0 note=72 velocity=80 time=1
note_on channel=0 note=57 velocity=0 time=215
note_on channel=0 note=72 velocity=0 time=24
note_on channel=0 note=74 velocity=80 time=1
note_on channel=0 note=59 velocity=80 time=0
note_on channel=0 note=74 velocity=0 time=455
note_on channel=0 note=67 velocity=80 time=25
note_on channel=0 note=67 velocity=0 time=239
note_on channel=0 note=67 velocity=80 time=241
note_on channel=0 note=67 velocity=0 time=239
note_on channel=0 note=59 velocity=0 time=168
MetaMessage('end_of_track', time=1)
```
### MIDI Text Format (MTF)  
The MIDI Text Format (MTF) provides a structured, textual representation of MIDI data that preserves all original information without loss. Each MIDI message is accurately represented, allowing full reconstruction, ensuring no musical nuances are overlooked during conversion.  

To generate MTF, the mido library reads raw MIDI messages from MIDI files. The output retains all essential information but can be lengthy and redundant. To simplify the representation, parameter values are read in a fixed order and separated by spaces. For example, the raw time signature message, which contains several parameters—numerator, denominator, clocks per click, notated 32nd notes per beat, and time—is represented in MTF as:  

```
time_signature 3 4 24 8 0
```

Other messages, such as control changes and note events, follow a similar compact format while preserving all relevant musical details. This structured simplification improves computational performance and maintains precise control over musical elements, including timing and dynamics.  

Example MTF representation:  
```
ticks_per_beat 480
time_signature 3 4 24 8 0
key_signature G 0
set_tempo 500000 0
control_change 0 0 121 0
program_change 0 0 0
control_change 0 0 7 100
control_change 0 0 10 64
control_change 0 0 91 0
control_change 0 0 93 0
midi_port 0 0
note_on 0 0 74 80
key_signature G 0
midi_port 0 0
note_on 0 0 55 80
note_on 0 0 59 80
note_on 0 0 62 80
note_on 455 0 74 0
note_on 25 0 67 80
note_on 239 0 67 0
note_on 1 0 69 80
note_on 191 0 55 0
note_on 0 0 59 0
note_on 0 0 62 0
note_on 48 0 69 0
note_on 1 0 71 80
note_on 0 0 57 80
note_on 239 0 71 0
note_on 1 0 72 80
note_on 215 0 57 0
note_on 24 0 72 0
note_on 1 0 74 80
note_on 0 0 59 80
note_on 455 0 74 0
note_on 25 0 67 80
note_on 239 0 67 0
note_on 241 0 67 80
note_on 239 0 67 0
note_on 168 0 59 0
end_of_track 1
```
For simplicity, `ticks_per_beat`, though originally an attribute of MIDI objects in mido, is included as the first message at the beginning of the MTF representation.

### M3-Encoded MTF  
When processed using M3 encoding, consecutive messages of the same type that fit within a 64-character limit (the patch size of M3) are combined into a single line. Only the first message in each group specifies the type, with subsequent messages listing only the parameter values separated by tabs. This further simplifies the representation and improves processing efficiency.  

Below is the same data optimized with M3 encoding, where each line corresponds to a patch:  
```
ticks_per_beat 480
time_signature 3 4 24 8 0
key_signature G 0
set_tempo 500000 0
control_change 0 0 121 0
program_change 0 0 0
control_change 0 0 7 100\t0 0 10 64\t0 0 91 0\t0 0 93 0
midi_port 0 0
note_on 0 0 74 80
key_signature G 0
midi_port 0 0
note_on 0 0 55 80\t0 0 59 80\t0 0 62 80\t455 0 74 0\t25 0 67 80
note_on 239 0 67 0\t1 0 69 80\t191 0 55 0\t0 0 59 0\t0 0 62 0
note_on 48 0 69 0\t1 0 71 80\t0 0 57 80\t239 0 71 0\t1 0 72 80
note_on 215 0 57 0\t24 0 72 0\t1 0 74 80\t0 0 59 80\t455 0 74 0
note_on 25 0 67 80\t239 0 67 0\t0 67 80\t239 0 67 0\t168 0 59 0
end_of_track 1
```

By reducing redundancy, M3 encoding ensures improved computational performance while maintaining precise timing and musical control, making it an ideal choice for efficient MIDI processing.

- **Logging**: Errors are logged to `logs/gpt4_summarize_error_log.txt`.

### 3. **Utilities**
- **`utils/`**: Contains utility files required for the conversion processes.

## Usage
To use the scripts, modify the `input_dir` variable in each script to point to the directory containing your input files. Then run the script from the command line. Below are example commands for each script:

### Example Commands
```bash
# Modify the input_dir variable in the script before running
python batch_abc2xml.py
python batch_xml2abc.py
python batch_interleaved_abc.py
python batch_midi2mtf.py
python batch_mtf2midi.py
python gpt4_summarize.py
```

### Execution Order
To achieve specific conversions, follow the order below:

1. **To obtain interleaved ABC notation**:
   - First, run `batch_xml2abc.py` to convert MusicXML files to ABC notation.
   - Then, run `batch_interleaved_abc.py` to process the ABC files into interleaved ABC notation.

2. **To obtain MTF**:
   - Run `batch_midi2mtf.py` to convert MIDI files into MTF.

3. **To convert interleaved ABC back to XML**:
   - Run `batch_xml2abc.py` on the interleaved ABC files to convert them back to MusicXML format.

4. **To convert MTF back to MIDI**:
   - Run `batch_mtf2midi.py` to convert MTF files back to MIDI format.

5. **To summarize music metadata**:
   - Run `gpt4_summarize.py` to generate summaries for the music metadata files in JSON format. This assumes you have a directory of JSON files that includes a `filepaths` key, which connects to the corresponding interleaved ABC and MTF files.

### Parameters
To run the scripts, you need to configure the following parameters:

- **`input_dir`**: This variable should be set to the directory containing the input files to be processed (such as ABC, MusicXML, MIDI, MTF, or JSON files), which is shared across all scripts.

In addition to **`input_dir`**, the following parameters are specific to certain scripts:

- **`m3_compatible`** (specific to `batch_midi2mtf.py`):
  - Default is `True`, which omits messages with parameters that are strings or lists to avoid including potential natural language information.
  - Setting this to `False` retains all MIDI messages, which is crucial for those planning to retrain models on custom datasets or needing precise MIDI reproduction.

For **`gpt4_summarize.py`**, you also need to configure these parameters:

1. **`base_url`**: The base URL for the OpenAI API, used to initialize the client.  
2. **`api_key`**: Your API key for authenticating requests, required for client initialization.  
3. **`model`**: The GPT-4 model to use, specified when generating summaries.

  **Important**: When `m3_compatible` is set to `True`, the conversion back from MTF to MIDI using `batch_mtf2midi.py` may produce MIDI files that do not exactly match the original MIDI files. This discrepancy is unexpected; however, retraining both M3 and CLaMP 2 to address this issue would require approximately 6000 hours of H800 GPU hours. Considering that M3 and CLaMP 2 have already achieved state-of-the-art results on MIDI tasks, we have opted not to retrain. Therefore, if consistency with original MIDI files is critical for your application, it is advisable to set `m3_compatible` to `False`.
